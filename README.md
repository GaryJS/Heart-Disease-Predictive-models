# Heart Disease Predictive Models

## Overview
This project explores machine learning to predict the risk if heart disease and heart attacks using clinical data.
The focus is on evaluating models that can support preventive care by identifying at-risk individuals before critical medical events occure.

## Models Used
-Logistic Regression
-Random Forest
-XGBoost
-Stacked Ensemble (Heart disease dataset only)
-SHAP for model explainability

## Libraries and Tools
-Python
-scikit-learn
-XGBoost
-SHAP
-Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Data Validation and Regulations
- This data set is for **educational purposes only**.
